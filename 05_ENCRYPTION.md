# Message Encryption

End-to-end encryption is a necessary part of any secure messaging protocol. In web3, one of the simplest techniques for achieving end-to-end encryption is the [Diffie-Hellman key exchange scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffieâ€“Hellman_key_exchange).

![Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Source: wikipedia.org](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Public_key_shared_secret.svg/500px-Public_key_shared_secret.svg.png)

In this scheme, two individuals who wish to message with each other are able to derive a shared secret key using a combination of their own private key and the other participant's public key. This shared secret key may then be used in an encryption/decryption algorithm without the need to communicate any sensitive information over a network.

## Disclaimer

It is an open question whether asymmetric keypairs typically used for signing should also be used to derive symmetric keys for encryption. With that said, the appeal of Diffie-Hellman in web3 is that users are already custodying keypairs for signing, and no new state needs to be maintained for encryption. For the purposes of this document, we make the assumption that the Diffie-Hellman scheme is an acceptable encryption technique.

## Proposal

We propose the addition of a two methods to wallet APIs for performing encryption & decryption:

```javascript
// both methods use the wallet instance's privateKey
async encrypt(options: { data: Uint8Array, publicKey: Uint8Array, nonce?: Uint8Array, version?: enum }): Promise<{data: Uint8Array, nonce: Uint8Array, version: enum }> {}
async decrypt(options: { data: Uint8Array, publicKey: Uint8Array, nonce: Uint8Array, version?: enum }): Promise<{data: Uint8Array, version: enum }> {}
```

These methods are inspired by the Metamask [encrypt](https://metamask.github.io/eth-sig-util/modules.html#encrypt) & [decrypt](https://metamask.github.io/eth-sig-util/modules.html#decrypt) standards, with some adjustments.

- `data` is the payload to encrypt or decrypt.
- `publicKey` is the public key of the other party with whom the wallet would like to send and receive encrypted data.
- `nonce` is an encryption nonce, & marked as optional in `encrypt`. If not provided, the encrypt method will generate and return a nonce. Otherwise, the provided nonce will be returned.
- `version` is a version specifier for what standard is being used for encryption. If none is provided to either encrypt or decrypt, a default will be used.

### Security

In a web extension environment, any dapps calling these methods over the extension's JSON RPC API will never have access to any representation of the users' private key, in the same way that `signTransaction` and other existing methods never do.

In a mobile wallet runtime with private key custody, the private key is never being directly handled by any third party code.

### Less secure, more flexible treatment of shared secret key (not proposed)

Alternatively, if we treat the shared secret key as accessible information, wallets could instead expose a single `diffieHellman` method that takes just the other party's public key as input:

```javascript
// uses the wallet instance's privateKey
async diffieHellman(publicKey: Uint8Array): Promise<secretKey: Uint8Array> {}
```

This function, while less opinionated about the intended usage of the shared secret key, does expose the shared secret key to the third party code executing in the runtime.

The [Sollet wallet](https://sollet.io) exposes a `diffieHellman` function, however this function poses a security risk. See below for more info.

## Background

### Problem

There is no standard, exposed method for wallets to perform encryption. Today, most web wallets support the following methods:

```
- signTransaction
- signAllTransactions
- signMessage
```

The first two methods are the familiar transaction signing methods for submitting transactions to the blockchain. The lesser-known `signMessage` method is a more general method for proving ownership, and is typically used for creating an authenticated payload for communicating with other services, proving ownership of a given wallet address.

### The Sollet `diffieHellman` API

The [Sollet wallet](https://sollet.io) is the only Solana wallet that exposes an encryption method. It does so via the [`diffieHellman` method](https://github.com/project-serum/spl-token-wallet/tree/0a4c2a00c09f2ce690dce686990a32b15e836f03/src/utils/diffie-hellman):

```javascript
// uses the wallet instance's privateKey
async diffieHellman(publicKey: UInt8Array): Promise<{publicKey: UInt8Array, secretKey: UInt8Array}> {}
```

However, this `diffieHellman` method is experimental, is not intended for production use, and returns keys in a form that poses a security risk. Specifically, it converts an `Ed25519` keypair & public key to a `Curve25519` keypair & public key, which is an intermediate step toward generating the shared secret key used for encryption.

This intermediate representation is reversible, and therefore the sollet `diffieHellman` method returns what is equivalent to the user's keypair to the broader javascript runtime, which is a critical security risk.

## Limitations & looking ahead

The Diffie-Hellman scheme is extendable beyond the one-to-one exchange described above, but [increases significantly in complexity](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/1027): work must be done by every participant any time a new member is added.

This poses a limitation on the user experience in web3, especially if messages and state are stored on-chain. Hence, encrypted group chats, especially those with fluid membership, may be difficult to manage.
